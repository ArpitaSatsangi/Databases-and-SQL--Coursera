Create tables using SQL scripts
In this exercise, you will learn how to execute a script containing the CREATE TABLE commands for 
all the tables rather than create each table manually by typing the DDL commands in the SQL editor.

Download the script file to your computer:

HR_Database_Create_Tables_Script.sql
Select the HR database. Later click on the Import tab.

Click on choose file. Browse for the file and upload it .

Later scroll down and click on Go.

The script then gets imported successfully.

Click on any of the tables and you will see its Table Definition (that is, its list of columns, data types, etc).
