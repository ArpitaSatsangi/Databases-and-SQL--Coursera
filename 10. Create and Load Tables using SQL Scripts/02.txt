Load data into tables
In this exercise, you will learn how data can be loaded into MySQL. You could manually insert each row into the table one by one, but that would take a long time. Instead, MySQL (and almost every other database) allows you to load data from .CSV files.

The steps below explain the process of loading data into the tables you created earlier in exercise 1.

Download the 5 .csv files below to your local computer:

Departments.csv
Employees.csv
Jobs.csv
Locations.csv
JobsHistory.csv
To load each table do the following steps.

Select each table .

Click on Import tab.

Select the csv file and click on Go to load the csv file.


Once the tables are loaded , you will get a message that the records are inserted successfully.


Further you can click on browse and view the data of each table.
